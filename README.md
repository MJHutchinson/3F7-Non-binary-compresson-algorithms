# Non-binary compression algorithms
_Third year coursework for module 3F7: Information Theory and Coding_

Data comprsson, or coding, is the act of reducing representation size of a set of data, typically by representing the data as a set of codewords. The motiation for this is clear - with a rapidly growing world stoage capacity, lossless and lossy compression can grow the amount of data we can store can grow even faster. Faster and better compression algorithms can help push this boundry even further. 

Current compression algorithms are implemented in binary. This report looks to explore extending a set of algorithms to in non binary bases. Encoding in bases that are powers of 2 are applicable on our current computer systems (e.g. base 256 encodes in bytes rather than bits) Quantum compters provide an interesing appication of bases of the form 2^N. A single qubit contains as much information a 2 classical bits, and N qubits superimpose to store 2^N classical bits of information. Exploiting this could lead to exponential incrases in storage capacity and encoding in higher bases would be a part of that.

Bases not of the for 2^N are a more academic pursuit,  but in theory are applicable to analogue systems whose signal to noise ratios make a base of this form less obvious (e.g. a noisy radio channel that would make best use of 3 distinct levels, rather than 2 or 4) 

## Results
The results of this investigation are documented in [the report submitted](Final_Report_with_Feedback.pdf). Due to a file system corruption issue (ironic I know) my copy of th report was lost, and so this is my partners copy of the report. The reports and feedback were very similar for the both of us.
